2. Operate Challenges

We runs lots of projects mentioned, faced with following:

2.1. Lots of paper work
Service clients signs lots of hard-copied documents at least every month. Newcomers must sign an agreement in hard-copied format to fit government requirements. Leavers also signs leaving-cormfirmation, also in hard-copied documents. Staffs handles lots of review on those hard-copied documents and uses lot of papers which are eco-non-friendly.

2.2. Lots of face-to-face supports, meetings
Service users which in housing services must attend face-to-face meetings once every month, whereas employment and training programs do the same thing but once at least half a year. Counseling and Support Service may need face-to-face counseling service for users and may spent some transport fees and treasurable times. Soical workers and frontiered staffs have some face-to-face courses and meetings, leaves on-premises, cannot really listen clients' needs.

2.3. No remote health check
This mainly occurs in housing service and employment programs. Client must on-premises body health check periodocially with non-AI powered, non-remote surveillance health check instruments. This occurs data could not shared better with families and relative units.

2.4. No AI-powered autonomous system update integrated
Lots of devices runs on outdated systems, not supported by Vendors' officials. Clients requested uses an updated system but rejected by administration reasons.
